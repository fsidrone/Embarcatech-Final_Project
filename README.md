Embarcatech is an intensive embedded systems course offered by the Hardware BR Institute. This project was developed as the final project for Embarcatech.
The main idea is to help people learn music using the BitDogLab development kit. A buzzer plays a random note, and the user must identify which note was played using a joystick.
The selected note is shown on an LCD display, along with feedback about whether the answer was correct.
